									<p>Hello! I'm a seasoned Data Analyst and Data Scientist with over a decade of experience. My journey began with a strong foundation in biological sciences and extended into a thriving career in the oil and gas sector, where I honed my managerial skills. My passion for data analysis led me to earn a Master's in Full Stack Data Science from 10Alytics in the UK.</p>

									<p>Throughout my career, I have developed and refined my expertise in using powerful tools such as Excel, PowerBI, Tableau, SQL and Python. My experience spans across multiple industries, including oil and gas, e-commerce, and more. I have successfully completed internships and freelance work with renowned organizations like Mentorness and 10Alytics, where I specialized in machine learning and data analytics.</p>

									<p>Currently, I work remotely as a Data Analyst for Visual Impact Multi-Biz Concept and Romona, providing valuable insights that drive business decisions. I also enjoy collaborating on platforms like Upwork, where I offer my analytical skills to a diverse range of clients.</p>

									<p>One of my key projects includes developing a sentiment analysis model for Amazon e-commerce reviews, where I utilized techniques such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and training models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Naive Bayes. My best-performing model, an SVM, was successfully deployed both locally and to the cloud using FastAPI and Streamlit.</p>

									
									<h3 class="major">Vision</h3>
									<p>My aim is to translate complex data into actionable insights, making data-driven decisions accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and am always on the lookout for innovative ways to solve problems using data.</p>

									<p>Welcome to my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you would like to collaborate or learn more about my work!</p>
